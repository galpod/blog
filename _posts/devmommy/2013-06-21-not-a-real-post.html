<p>Tomorrow, I’m leaving for a two weeks trip. Actually, <i>we</i> are leaving for a two weeks trip. We are going to meet with grandparents, so I’m going to call it vacation, rather than a family holiday. In terms of scheduling, I hope my next blog post will be on the second week of July. In terms of research, I plan to research cross-cultural differences between North American and European conceptualizations of wine, ice cream, and family time. In the meantime, <a href="http://galpod.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/on-the-effects-of-vacations/">here’s</a> a post I wrote on the effects of vacation on work-related stress. See you in July :)</p>
