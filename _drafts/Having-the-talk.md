The other day, we were sitting in a car, and my son turns to me and says, "mom, I read in this book that for babies to go into the mom's tummy, the dad has to put his penis into the mom's vagina". Some thoughts running through my head were "Oh boy" and "what books are you reading and why don't I know that?". After I established that said book is the book he took out of the school library for holiday reading (it's called ["The Big Book of Knowledge"](https://www.dk.com/uk/9781409333258-big-book-of-knowledge/) and is quite informative, actually), we answered that, yes, when people are adults&mdash;that's 21 years old in our house, and we consider it a negotiation starting point&mdas;and when they love each other and they both agree, that's how the baby can get into the mom's tummy. He was quite incredulous, but we assured him that yes, that's technically the methodology. The way my son works out how something works is, he asks questions, and then mulls the answer over, sometimes for a few days or weeks, and then comes back to the topic and asks another question. The next day I had to correct the (quite reasonable) misconception that when the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina he pees there (because he doesn't know any other uses for his penis yet, he's 8), and this is where the situation stands. I'm pretty sure we have more discussions on the topic to come. So, in preparation, I'm looking at research about what's the best way to talk to children about sex. Therefore, this post will be a little different, more like an annotated bibliography for parents or carers who are looking for resources. Note that I will update this post as we go through this discussion, so it's worth while checking back to see how we're doing :smile:

The first thing I did was re-watch Julia Sweeney's hilarious [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/julia_sweeney_has_the_talk). It's a five-minute guide on how not to accidentally lead your child to internet porn, which can be quite useful.

Then, I looked at the Mayo Clinic, because they're a good and reliable site. They have a good guide for [parents of toddlers](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/sexual-health/in-depth/sex-education/art-20044104) and a good guide for [parents of teens](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/sexual-health/in-depth/sex-education/art-20044034), but nothing for the in-between, to my disappointment.

I looked at a few books, in Hebrew and in English. The problem with my kids is that they're too old for most of the picture books, and I didn't want to get a book about puberty because that's jumping the gun a little bit (I hope). I did find a book called ["Let's Talk About the Birds and the Bees"](https://www.bloomsbury.com/au/lets-talk-about-the-birds-and-the-bees-9781472946447/) which I really liked, although it does have some stuff about puberty there's also other things like the topic at hand, what's it like being a parent, and what love is all about. We'll get going with this and I'll report back.

I found a study looking at how parents talk to their children about sex. This study is basically a review of lots of other studies. It's not a meta-analysis, but it does have very interesting insights about how and when parents talk to their kids about sex. Here are a few interesting insights:
* Mothers do the majority of sex education de facto.
* Mothers mostly discuss sex with their daughters.
* Talking to kids about sex does not make them start having sex. In fact, talking about sex is associated with later sexual activity and healthier sexual behaviour (such as practising safe sex). Whew!
