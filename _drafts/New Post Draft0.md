*This post is part of a series I'm doing about children, parents, and media. If you are interested in these topics from a parent/carer perspective, please join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1456686561021212/) in which we are discussing these issues. Also, if you live on Facebook I have a [page](https://www.facebook.com/devmommy/) for the blog which you can check out.*

Over the last few posts we saw that, while there's [no digital replacement for parental quality time](https://galpod.com/parents-vs-media), children can actually [learn quite a bit from media](https://galpod.com/can-children-learn-from-media) in all kinds of ways. The [problem](https://t.co/ekyC4Vf4SN) is, if you only read [headlines](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/06/children-watched-terror-attacks-social-media-could-suffer-ptsd/), you'd be [led to believe](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40643904) that using [any type of media](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Safety-Concerns-Children-Kids-App-Yellow-Roblox-Keith-Jones.html) can [put your children at risk](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40566026). And the effects of media on children definitely *can* be negative. There's a considerable body of research showing, for instance, the negative effect of playing violent video games. Specifically, violent video games increase aggression, which is a social behaviour. But if children can learn from video games, why not use that to teach them positive behaviour? Today I'll talk about positive learning from media outside of the classroom. Using digital media in the classroom, by the way, is a whole different story which is related but not entirely the same as what we've talked about so far. We'll get to this topic later on in the series. Promise.  

In the conference I attended last month, I heard a fantastic talk from [Isabela Granic](https://twitter.com/PlayNiceInst). I absolutely love her attitude, which is: kids love video games, so we might as well make it good for them. But not in a didactic, preaching kind of way (which kids will stop loving in a hurry); let's make video games good for kids in a fun and beautiful way.

So they did. She showed us in a game they developed in her lab, together with game designers, called [MindLight](http://theplayniceinstitute.com/mindlight-2/). This game uses neurofeedback to teach anxious children how to stay calm. Neurofeedback is generally a pretty cool technique, and in this case they are using it to detect anxiety vs calm. So the child has to stay calm and that gives her all kinds of bonuses in the game.
