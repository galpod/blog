I'm reading a fantastic book called ["The Importance of Being Little"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25614522-the-importance-of-being-little). It's slow work because I don't get much spare time this year--I've started volunteering in all sorts of places to keep myself busy. However, this book gives me lots of "leads"--interesting articles I'd like to read and tell you about. So, if you are in the education sector, I highly recommend this book. I'll work through some of the articles I've found in there, so the next few posts are likely going to be preschool-classroom-related.

I'll start with a story from two years ago. I went to see daycares and schools when we moved to London, to decide which one we'd like to send the kids into. My son was supposed to start school (they start school early here, with a sort of kindergarten class called "reception", which starts when the kids are around 4 years old). My daughter was to attend nursery (daycare) for a year before she'd also go to school. I was looking at several places, and one place struck me as very visually busy. There were lots and lots of things on the walls---letters, numbers, science posters, story lines, you name it. It was hard for me to focus on what the nursery coordinator was telling me because I kept being distracted by all the brightly-coloured stuff around me. I remember thinking that they were trying too hard. I later found out that their [Ofsted](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofsted) score (a score given by the government to educational institutions; anything less than excellent usually drives a lot of parents away) was not great and they were gearing up for an inspection. It was like they thought that the more stuff they have on the walls, the better the quality of the education is.

You might think, well, what's the harm of putting a few extra stuff on the walls to make the kids' environment a little more cheery? They have to spend their whole day in there, it might as well look nice and inviting. And I tend to agree that some pictures on the walls make a room more inviting and friendly. But apparently, heavily decorated classroom actually interfere with learning. How do I know that? Well, there's a study.

##What They Did
The authors of this study wanted to examine whether classroom decorations interfere with learning. They actually have a good rationale: young children's executive functions---including inhibitory control and working memory
