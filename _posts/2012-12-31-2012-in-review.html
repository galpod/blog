<p>Not bad for a first year, but it sure leaves room for a lot of New Year Resolutions :)</p>
<p>The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2012 annual report for this blog.</p>

<p>Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner can carry about 250 passengers. This blog was viewed about <strong>1,400</strong> times in 2012. If it were a Dreamliner, it would take about 6 trips to carry that many people.</p></blockquote>
