_Quick note: I'm in the process of moving my blog to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), mostly because my techie partner said I should. I will have my blog on my own domain, but will keep updating the wordpress blog until the transformation is complete (which will be when I've finished going over the posts and updating them). If you would like to continue (or begin) to get this blog to your email, you may have to re-register. Stay tuned for updates!_

This post is a bit more theoretical than the one last week. It's because I've seen [this article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23570816_Thirty_years_on_-_A_large_anti-Flynn_effect_%28II%29_13-_and_14-year-olds._Piagetian_tests_of_formal_operations_norms_1976-20067) from a researcher I regard highly, but I have so many issues with their conclusion that I just have to write about it. So, basically, this is going to be a _bit_ of a rant. Consider yourself warned.

So, the authors examined the performance of 13- and 14-year-olds on Piagetian tests. Piaget was basically the father of cognitive development: he was the first person to document children's thinking at different ages, and to note that children do not think in the same way as adults. Most of his work was published in the 1960s, and he was very influential in the 1970s, but the influence of his ideas diminished in the 80s when the information-processing theories began to gain popularity. This is a very imprecise history, but you can read more details in many other places. Generally, Piaget had developed some tests that were designed to measure children's 

Last week, an opportunity arose when my daughter commissioned her daddy to take her to a friend‚Äôs birthday party (‚Äúbut no drop-off, daddy! You have to stay the WHOLE time.‚Äù). So, my son and I went to the British Museum. For a geeky 6-year-old and his nerdy mama, the British Museum is anthropological heaven. We saw all kinds of things: [mummies](https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/mummy-of-cleopatra-from-thebes/twFIeHry_l2q9g), [the Rosetta Stone](https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-rosetta-stone/DgH6pMM1guUUPA), [6000 years old flint knives](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/Ow2_U_tATPCxZZ1cthM8gQ), and things that were buried in a ship [1300 years ago](http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/europe/room_41_europe_ad_300-1100.aspx).

This got me thinking about museums and how children learn. Naturally, I consulted [Google Scholars](https://scholar.google.ca/)¬†and found a [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12252/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=) done in Chicago about how talking to your kids help them learn. As we are a family who [talks a lot](https://galpod.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/on-answering-tough-questions/) (I‚Äôm the least chatty person in our family, if you can imagine), I was very happy to find this paper.

### What They Did

The researchers wanted to look at the effects of having conversation cards (with open-ended questions on them), as well as having a physical object (a hands-on experience). So they [randomly assigned](http://galpod.wordpress.com/glossary#randomassignment) families into one of 4 groups: families who received no activity, families who received only conversation cards, families who received only physical objects, and families who received both (this is a very neat [2x2 design](http://galpod.wordpress.com/glossary#2x2design)).

They then took the families to an exhibit that contained the target objects (the cards were about the same objects), and then to another exhibit that was linked, but did not contain the exact same objects. I thought the second exhibit was a nice addition¬†because they could look at transfer‚Äîwhether the families talked about what they saw in the first exhibit when they were going through the second exhibit.

### What They Found

Parents who received the cards used more elaborative talk while going through the exhibit. Parents use elaborative talk when they ask the child open-ended questions (‚ÄúWhat do you think this was used for?‚Äù) and when they make explicit connections with prior knowledge (‚ÄúThis is very different from your bed‚Äù). Elaborative talk is important because it helps children engage with what they are seeing, and anchors the things they see in their own daily experiences, which are very concrete.

The parents who received the cards (regardless of whether or not the families received the physical objects) also made more connections between the second and the first exhibit, supporting children‚Äôs transfer of knowledge. This means that the child is more likely to be able to transfer this knowledge to new settings, such as the classroom.

They also found that children whose families received the cards made more spontaneous comments while going through the exhibition, and they also made more associations between the second and the first exhibits.

### What It Means

The British Museum has ‚Äúfamily trails‚Äù‚Äîbasically booklets that take you to certain items along the galleries and explain about them. They have some activities on them (such as, ‚Äútalk about what you would bring to your after-life‚Äù. I‚Äôm not kidding.), but from this research it would appear that sitting down before going into the exhibit and talking about what we are going to see might have helped my son to get more out of the experience. Personally, I was a bit disappointed when all my son could remember the next day was that he has the best eye-sight in the family¬†because he spotted all the items we were supposed to find on our ‚Äútrail‚Äù. Not exactly what I was hoping for in terms of learning.

So, if you are taking your kids to a museum, ask them lots of open-ended questions and connect what you see to their lives (try not to invoke discussions about death if your kid is young¬†unless you **really** want to). If you have a few extra minutes at home before you head out, take a peek at the museum‚Äôs website and find something you want them to see. Show it to them, and talk about it on the way: talk about why you want to see it, what you think the museum people wrote on the sign beside it, what would you use if for if you had one at home, and so on. It might be a fun talk üòÄ
