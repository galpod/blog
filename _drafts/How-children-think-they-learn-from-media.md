So, here's a fascinating topic: children and the media. It's a [topic](https://galpod.com/are-e-books-evil) I've [written](https://galpod.com/can-you-say-interaction) about several(https://galpod.com/do-kids-use-too-much-media) times. Generally, I'm of the opinion that, like everything else in parenting, [moderation](https://galpod.com/Number-of-Books-and-Education) and communication is key. No screen (by screen I mean smart-things, i-things, TV, computers, and e-books) is a really hard rule to stick by these days, especially by the time your first enters school. If not through other students, children are being exposed to screens in class. And in my opinion, our job as parents is to teach children **how** to watch TV and interact with screens, and we can't do that if we forbid it completely. But can children learn from screens? Is there any benefit at all for having screens as an educational tools? Is there a problem with using screens as an educational tool?

The short answer is, we don't know. Smart-things and touchscreens, for instance, simply haven't been around long enough for a solid, longitudinal, informative research. And I totally get the approach that if we don't know that something isn't bad for development, we should avoid it until we do know. It's an approach that would have been useful in [agriculture](https://riverford.co.uk), for instance, 30 years ago, when we didn't know the harmful effects of pesticides. But I'm not sure that real parents in middle-class modern society can actually prevent their children from ever seeing a screen. So, let's talk about what we do know about learning from screens.

First, the "against" evidence. There are clear evidence that babies **cannot learn language from a screen**. This has been shown in several well-designed studies that found that it's the interaction between the adult and the baby that drives language learning. There are also some studies that find that children&mdash;especially young children&mdash; have a hard time generalising what they learn in a 2D world into the 3D world. And that makes developmental sense, because younger children find it hard to generalise, well, in general. The main characteristic of young children's thinking is that it's concrete. Children understand things as they pertain to their personal, concrete world. It is only later on, in mid-primary school more or less, that children begin to understand more abstract concepts, and their ability to understand abstract concepts continues to grow until they are at least in their late teens. In other words, the screen is not necessarily worse than, say, books or pictures. Children, especially young children, learn best from actions and people.

Now, let's talk about the "for" evidence.

What do children think? Well, recent studies show that preschoolers (3-5 years old) do not show preference for learning between a book and a tablet. They consider both books and tablets equally valid tools for learning about the world. Six-year-olds show some preference for learning from a touchscreen, but only in certain cases.
