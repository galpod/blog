<address>How we influence our children's behaviour and compliance.</address>

<p>As I was reading “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/books/review/pamela-druckermans-bringing-up-bebe.html?_r=0">Bringing Up Bébé</a>” (which is a whole other post that I don’t know if I’ll ever write) it struck me that the author assumes that the way French parents behave makes their children more compliant. As a developmental researcher, I of course performed a “<a href="http://scholar.google.ca/">scholar search</a>”, and came across several interesting studies. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2850123/">One of them</a> was published a few years ago, and was really interesting.</p>
<h2>What they Did</h2>
<p>The authors examined the relationship between parenting behaviours and other demographic factors, such as gender and socioeconomic status, and the development of inhibitory control. If you need a refresher on what inhibitory control is and why it’s important, you can read about it <a href="http://galpod.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/when-simon-doesnt-say-inhibitory-control-in-children/">here</a> and <a href="http://galpod.wordpress.com/2012/06/16/children-ignoring-distractions-fact-or-fiction/">here</a>. I’ll wait.</p>
<p>So, this study had parents fill out a questionnaire assessing their child’s inhibitory control skills, and their parenting behaviours were assessed by the researchers during a home visit. The question was which variables would affect the initial level of inhibitory control at age 2 years, and which variables would affect the growth of inhibitory control between 2 and 4 years of age.</p>
<h2>What They Found</h2>
<p>There were two interesting findings about parenting. First, harsh parenting only influenced the initial level of inhibitory control but not the development. That is, harsh parenting was associated with lower levels of inhibitory control at age 2, but not with a slower growth of inhibitory control between the ages 2 and 4. In contrast, supportive parenting was associated with increased growth of inhibitory control over the two-year period, but it was not related with the initial levels.</p>
<h2>What it Means</h2>
<p>I think that we can combine these findings with what I <a href="http://galpod.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/more-than-words/">talked about a few weeks ago</a> regarding the praise we give. I said then that parenting a two-year-old is really different from parenting a four-year-old. As I’m doing both right now, I’m keenly aware of that. There’s a different focus, a different set of expectations, and of course different things “tick us off”. If my two-year-old is unable to follow the post-dinner routine, for example, I remind her and make it into a game. If my four-year-old skips his “duties” (brushing teeth, taking plate off the table, etc.) I’m more likely to get snippy because he should know better by now. So I can see how being patient rather than harsh helps the two-year-olds, but that later on a bit of annoyance isn’t all that harmful (and really quite reasonable). Similarly, I can see how being supportive and involved with the child is a bit over their head at 2, but can go a long way in later years. Of course, I don’t mean you shouldn’t talk to your child until she’s three, but there’s a qualitative difference, I think, between how you approach a similar situation with a two-year-old and with a four-year-old.</p>
