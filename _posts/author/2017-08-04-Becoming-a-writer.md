When I was little, I would make stories up. All children do. You, too, probably made stories up when you were little. Sometimes it's called pretend play: you play being a doctor, or a patient, or a mommy, or a cop, or a 10-year-old girl whose family lives in the street (this one is my daughter's current favourite).

When I was a little older, I was told to stop making stories up. I was told to focus on reality. This, too, happens to many people. I wanted to be a writer when I was in primary school, but my parents told me that making stories up is not a proper job. And I believed them, despite being an avid reader. It did not occur to me that somebody had to write all these books I was reading. I thought about being a journalist for a little while, but when I discovered psychology I was rather hooked. And after I finished my BA, I went on to do my MA and PhD. So, in a way, I kept writing. But I was writing non-fiction. I wasn't making stories up&mdash;I was writing about reality. With evidence.

Towards the end of my PhD, I had an idea that I thought would make for a good book. I had a story to tell. I started looking into this, and it became more and more reasonable for me to write this book. It became more and more appealing. I couldn't ignore "the call" anymore. But I couldn't do it yet. I was too scared. So I said to myself, "I don't have time right now. When I'm done the PhD I'll write the book". And that was fine for a while.

Then I finished my PhD, but I wasn't ready yet. So I wrote a couple of short stories, and started working on an academic paper I should be writing. And I told myself, "I'll finish the paper first, then I can write the book". And that was fine for a while. And of course now my second academic paper is being edited, and there are no more excuses.

But now I'm ready. I have an immensely supportive partner with a good income so I don't have to worry about that (and I'm fully aware of how privileged that is). My kids are in school (some free time) but not old enough to be independent after school, so working full time would be quite the logistical nightmare. The conditions are favourable.

It is scary. I've relocated with my family twice (the second with small children), did an empirical research PhD, and served two years in the army. This is by far the most scared I've ever been. So I'm doing what I know. I'm writing about it. Just by writing this post I have ideas to a few others, but I also have experience blogging, so I'm not making grand announcements. When I have something to say, I'll write about it here. If I have time. Hope you'll come along for the ride.
