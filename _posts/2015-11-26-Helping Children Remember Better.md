##A Short Intervention Improves Preschoolers' Working Memory


_Quick note: I'm in the process of moving my blog to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), mostly because my techie said I should. I will have my blog on my own domain, but will keep updating the WordPress blog until the transformation is complete (which will be when I've finished going over the posts and updating them). If you would like to continue (or begin) to get this blog to your email, you may have to re-register. Stay tuned for updates!_

A [new article](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01827/abstract) about an intervention to improve children's executive functions caught my eye this week. This was done by [Emma Blakey](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emma_Blakey), a Ph.D. student at Sheffield University. Interventions are particularly scary for Ph.D. students because if the intervention doesn't work you need to start from scratch, so just putting it out there: way to go Emma for a courageous foray! :smile:

###What They did
The authors wanted to see whether an intervention would improve 4-year-olds' working memory skills. For those of you who do not feel like going back to read my old posts about it (though you should, they are very good! :smile:), [working memory](https://galpod.com/the-memory-game) is the ability to hold and manipulate information in mind. So, for instance, in order to do sums in your head (like 3+5=?) you need both to remember the question and to process it and figure out the answer. It is thought to be a part of [executive functions](https://galpod.com/whos-the-executive), which are a group of cognitive processes that enable goal-directed behaviour (basically, anything you **don't** do on autopilot).

The experimenters measured a bunch of things at the beginning of the study (very important, to make sure the groups are similar), and then [randomly assigned](https://galpod.com/glossary#random-assignment) children to either a training group or a control group, ran the intervention (the control group got tasks that did not train executive functions, which is an excellent way to have a control group), and then re-measured the same skills (a [pre-post design](https://galpod.com/glossary#pre-post-design)). They also measured the children in a follow-up after 3 months, and threw in a maths assessment.

###What They Found
Children in the training group improved on working memory measures more than the children in the control group (everyone improved a little bit from the first time they did the task to the second time they did it, which is to be expected). They did not improve on any of the other measures. This lack of improvement on the other measures is particularly telling because the intervention included an [inhibitory control](https://galpod.com/when-simon-doesnt-say-inhibitory-control-in-children) part, which appears to have done fairly little.

I have a couple of issues with this study. First, they did not separate the working memory intervention from the inhibitory control intervention. Sure, it would have required to double the sample size, because ideally you want to use a [2x2 design](https://galpod.com/glossary#x2-design) with some children in the control group, some getting just a working memory training, some children getting just an inhibitory control training, and some children getting both training types. But it would have told us a much more interesting story. Another issue I have is with their statistical analysis: they had several outcome measures but they did not run them in an analysis that includes all of them, but in separate analyses, one for each measure. For the purpose of this blog I'll just say it was not the appropriate analysis, and that it increases the chances of finding a significant finding accidentally (more details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem)). That said, the effect of the working memory training on maths skills 3 months later was astounding, so that one is probably a true effect.

###What It Means
There are three interesting parts to this study. The first is that you can train working memory in 4-year-olds. Given the fairly large number of studies that have already found that you can train working memory in [older children](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/icd.1816/abstract) and in [adults](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3313479/), this finding is not surprising. But we have very little studies doing interventions with 4-year-olds, so it's good that the authors have done that.

The second interesting part to this study is that the effects of the interventions were transferred to maths skills 3 months later. This could be for a host of reasons that this study cannot speak to, but still, really interesting. Working memory and maths are related in [all kinds of interesting ways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23168083). Specifically, what this study suggests is that we may be able to create a curriculum for preschoolers that would help them with their maths skills later on.

The third interesting part to this study is the **lack** of effects on inhibitory control and [cognitive flexibility](https://galpod.com/stretching-the-mind) measures. It could mean that these skills are un-trainable. I can see that on inhibitory control: it's [really hard](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19120418) to train kids on inhibitory control tasks, and that makes a lot of sense to me. It's one of those skills that you have to wait for the child to be mature enough (kind of like potty training, talking, and walking). You can't really rush them. The lack of effect on cognitive flexibility in my opinion speaks to the fact that it is not just a more complex skill, as the authors mention, but also that it is a bit removed from the more basic skills such as working memory and inhibitory control. That's why, I think, a working memory and inhibitory control training did not have an effect on cognitive flexibility.

To answer the question I'm sure many of you are asking: yes, you can probably help your child with their working memory skills. The training the authors used was simply other working memory tasks, in which feedback was given. So, practice makes perfect: ask children what happened already when you're reading a story, or do some simple sums without writing things down. These will not only help practice their working memory, they are also good for literacy and maths (respectively). And play memory games. These will not only provide working memory practice, but also some family-togetherness time. And tell them they've done a good job when they succeed, or just give them a [thumbs-up](https://galpod.com/double-thumbs-up)
Happy Playing! :smile:
