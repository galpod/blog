*This post is part of the series on children and media. We are venturing from the [home environment](https://galpod.com/parents-vs-media) into school environment. Again, if you are interested in this topic, please come join us on Facebook, where I run a [participatory research group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1456686561021212/) in which we discuss all issues related to children and media*


My kids are lucky. We lucked into a great free school in a rather posh neighbourhood. In addition to having a great approach to learning, the school also has an incredible PTA. The PTA is an organisation comprised of parents (mostly moms), whose job it is to raise money for "extras" for the kids in the school. The money is used to fix up the playground, take entire classes to swimming lessons, loan musical instruments to entire classes, and&mdash;and here I'm getting to the point&mdash;provide iPads for entire classes. There are trollies with 30 iPads on them in the school, and they are being rolled around to classes in accordance with a strict schedule, but all classes get them at least once a week. In addition to ICT (information, communication, & technology) classes, in which the children learn how to operate a touch screen and how to program, they also use the touch screens for searching for information about the topics they are covering in class, such as the lives of Romans or how caterpillars become butterflies.

This use of touch screens in class is one of the hallmarks of a "good school". At least that's what principles or the marketing branches of schools seem to think, as every school brochure I've seen talks about how technologically advanced the school is, as if being technologically advance is a guarantee of the school's quality. So, I'm interested in the research. Is there evidence that using touch screens actually helps children learn things in the class?
