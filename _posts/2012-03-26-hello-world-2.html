<p>Writing is one of my passions. As such, I chose to train in order to become a university professor. That was 10 years ago. I'll let you know how it's working out.</p>
<p>But seriously, as a mommy of 2 quite small children and a developmental researcher in the making, I thought I might have something to contribute to the mommy discussion. I know every mommy and her sister has a blog nowadays, but I'm hoping to give mine a more professional twist.</p>
<p>That said, the first thing I found out about being a developmental researcher and a mom is that you can read all the books in the world, and when the moment of truth arrives, you are just as clueless as the rest of the mommies. All you can do is take a deep breath and let your kids teach you what your professors never could.</p>
<p>So here goes - my take on developmental issues from my own personal perspective, and as they pop into my head pretty much. I hope we all enjoy the ride! :)</p>
